## Base dev box
Updated dev box based on inherited config from MakerSquare. Fixed rbenv rights issue(requires sudo), added rails and meteor.

### includes:
-Rails
-Rbenv
-NodeJS
-MeteorJS
-Sqlite3
-PostgreSQL
-Git
-VIM
-ohmyzsh
-Pry
-Mini Magick

#### When running meteor, run 'sudo meteor' to get the meteor server correctly talking to the database.
#### If you need Mongo installed for something other than MeteorJS, I would highly suggest installing seperately.
